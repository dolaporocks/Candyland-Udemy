# Candyland-Udemy
This is just a simple website created working on my web developer bootcamp certification using HTMl, CSS, Bootsrap, a bit of Javascript and a bit of JQuery

Working on this project helped me to see the different functionalities that could be put together with bootstrap and CSS if you take your time with it. 
Following my instructor, I worked on this project and plaayed around with it in my own way to fully get the hang of it. 
It's a very simple website but working on this helped me explore more and do more research into the various classes bootstrap has to offer.
